      Starting your own club
    </td>
    <td>If these clubs do not already exist at your school, you could start a brand new, AI Club or Computer Science Club. Once your club has enough interest to begin formal meetings, youâ€™ll need some ideas to kick off your regular meetings. Teaching various coding languages and topics they may be interested in learning such as C, C++, Python, and Web DesignDiscussions. CS related topics, like certain algorithms and small projects in AI would also help boost the popularity of your club. It is also important to note that you can add aspects of other fields of interests that CS is applicable to, such as: law, medicine, etc.</td>
    <td>This process may be lengthy as you will need to gather a support team to help you get started as well as a teacher supervisor that most schools require to supervise the club after school. Some ideas for creating a new club is to find competitions to attend, create engaging lessons of content outside the school curriculum, and market your club thoroughly.</td>
